abstract = {Although ditches limit surface water contamination, groundwater recharge through ditches in Mediterranean catchments may result in groundwater contamination. We analysed the dynamics of pesticide percolation in ditches by conducting an original lab experiment that mimicked the successive percolation processes that occur during a flood season. Nine successive percolation events were operated on an undisturbed soil column collected from a ditch bed. The infiltrating water was doped with 14C-Diuron at concentrations that were chosen to decrease between the events so as to correspond to values observed during actual flood events. The water and solute fluxes were monitored during each event, and the final extractable and non-extractable Diuron residues in the column were determined. Two main observations were made. First, a high leaching potential was observed through the ditch bed over a succession of infiltrating flood events, with 58.9% of the infiltrated Diuron and its metabolites leaching. Second, compared with the contamination of surface water circulating in the ditches, the contamination of seepage water exhibited smaller peak values and persisted much longer because of the desorption of Diuron residues stored in the ditch bed. Thus, ditches serve as buffering zones between surface and groundwater. However, compared with field plots, ditches appear to be a preferential location for the percolation of pesticides into groundwater at the catchment scale.}

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work seeks to synthesise the knowledge on the use of cover crops in vineyards in the last 20 years, emphasising on the one hand, soil characteristics such as nutrition, organic carbon, structure or erosion and, on the other hand, environmental factors such as soil and biodiversity in vineyards, and gas emissions.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;A systematic review was made using Scopus-index journals for the past 20 years (1999 - 2018). The selection was independently done by two researchers, selecting a total of 272 published papers related to cover crops in the vineyard. Each article was categorised according to its theme and metadata were created, considering all relevant information from an agro-ecological point of view.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;The use of cover crops has a positive effect on the vineyard by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC), improving water infiltration and aggregate stability, and reducing erosion and greenhouse gases emission to the atmosphere. Furthermore, there is an increase in biodiversity, both in soil and the vineyard. Finally, cover crops do not constitute as a rule a major competition for nutrients to the vines except for nitrogen when grass covers are used. Contrarily, legume cover crops generally increase N in the soil, although its availability for plants is not immediate.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;This review constitutes an objective tool to help growers when considering the use of cover crops in vineyards that, based in a systematic review, provides relevant information depending on the characteristics of the growing condition of the vineyard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The present systematic review aims to provide an overview of the impact of cover crops on vegetative growth and the productive parameters of vineyards.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;A systematic review was made on Scopus-index journals dating from 1999 to 2018. The selection was made at the same time by two different researchers, who selected a total of 272 published papers related to cover crops in vineyards. Each article was categorised according to its theme and a metadata database was created, considering all relevant information from an agronomic point of view for each article.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It can be concluded from the review that the use of cover crops can reduce vine vegetative growth, which in turn can help keep the incidence of fungal diseases (like grey mould) at a low level. In general, this practice does not have a clear effect on vineyard yield or grape juice parameters, like total soluble solids (TSS) or titratable acidity (TA). Cover crops can decrease vineyard pests to a certain extent, especially &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Cicadellidae&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Cover crops can sometimes sporadically cause water stress in the vineyard, but only during the summer months.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;This review allowed us to summarise available information on cover crops and their effects on vineyard agronomic performance in a systematic way. Such information can be used to help select the most suitable cover, based on specific vineyard objectives and growing conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract = {Pesticides harm the environment and the health of applicators and rural populations. Although several levers exist to help reduce agricultural pesticide use, farmers hesitate to use them because they can require specific training, costly materials, and additional worktime while often decreasing yields. In this study, our objective was to design and develop an ad hoc role-playing game that can be used to design strategies of change for agricultural practices to reduce the unwanted impacts of pesticide use at farm and watershed scale. The main challenge was to create a game that is realistic and relevant to actors while bringing new knowledge to foster learning. We developed a participatory process to build the game and then complemented it with original contributions from research: the results of innovative field experiments and the design of simple assessment indicators corresponding to the evaluation criteria of actors. Our case study was a vineyard watershed subject to heavy pesticide use. Interview surveys with farmers and workshops with local actors (including farmers) and experts were employed to build the game, which included a spatial typology of farms, a simple calculator of potential impacts, and two types of roles. In the role of winegrower, the participants propose changes in practices for a virtual farm. In the role of public administrator, they evaluate the winegrowers' requests and the evolution of potential impacts, and then suggest further changes. The game was played with local actors and experts, separately. Game results were analyzed in terms of changes in practices, subsidy requests, and the evolution of potential impacts, both at the scale of farm types and the entire watershed.In the two game sessions, all participants modified the practices of their virtual farms. This revealed common and divergent choices between the group of experts and the group of local actors. Experts requested more plot-scale subsidies. They were also more ambitious in managing fungi and decreasing glyphosate use. At the watershed scale there were few differences between the potential impacts of the strategies as designed by the two different groups. However, the different attitudes of local actors and experts revealed different perceptions on investment, risks, and subsidies.This is the first game developed at a territorial scale to co-design and assess agricultural systems aimed at reducing unwanted impacts of pesticide use. The game is limited by the absence of economic and yield impacts, which should be a priority in the development of future versions of the game.}
